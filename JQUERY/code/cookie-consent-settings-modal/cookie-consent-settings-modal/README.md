## Usage

### Construct

Initialize the cookie consent framework with the constructor

```js
var cookieSettings = new BootstrapCookieConsent(props)
```

You may configure the framework with the `props` object. The default
configuration is

```js
this.props = {
    autoShowDialog: true, // disable autoShowModal on the privacy policy and legal notice pages, to make these pages readable
    lang: navigator.language, // the language, in which the modal is shown
    languages: ["en", "de"], // supported languages (in ./content/), defaults to first in array
    contentURL: "./content", // this URL must contain the dialogs content in the needed languages
    cookieName: "cookie-consent-settings",  // the name of the cookie in which the configuration is stored as JSON
    cookieStorageDays: 365, // the duration the cookie configuration is stored on the client
    postSelectionCallback: undefined // callback function, called after the user has made his selection
}
```

### Show dialog again

On a new visit the dialog is shown automatically. 
For reconfiguration show the Dialog again with 

```js
cookieSettings.showDialog()
```

### Read the settings in JavaScript

Read all cookie settings with 

```js 
cookieSettings.getSettings()
```
It should return some JSON like

```json
{"necessary":true,"analyses":false}
```
or 
`undefined`, before the user has choosen his cookie options.

Read a specific cookie setting with

```js
cookieSettings.getSettings('analyses')
```
for the `analyses` cookie settings. Also returns `undefined`, before the user has choosen 
his cookie options.

### Read the settings with a PHP script on the server

You can read the settings with all server languages, you just have to read the cookie and decode the JSON.

This is an PHP example how to read, if 'analyses' was allowed. 

```PHP
$consentCookieJson = @$_COOKIE['cookie-consent-settings'];
if ($consentCookieJson) {
    $consentCookie = json_decode($consentCookieJson);
    if($consentCookie && $consentCookie->analyses) {
        // do analysing things here
    }
}
```
